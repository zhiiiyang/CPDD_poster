# Introduction

Evidence that use of **e-cigarettes** with certain product characteristics may `increase` adolescent and young adult risk of unhealthy tobacco use patterns—such as frequency of combustible cigarette smoking—can inform regulation of e-cigarettes. 

# Methods

- Data were collected via online survey from participants in the Southern California Children’s Health Study in 2015-2016 (baseline) and 2016-2017 (follow-up) (**N=1312**). 
- We evaluated the association of binary categories of three non-mutually exclusive characteristics of the e-cigarette used most frequently with number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days at 1-year follow-up.
- Product characteristics included `device` (pen-like/mod [modifiable device]), use of `nicotine` in eliquid solutions (yes/no), and use for `dripping` (directly dripping eliquid onto the device for high levels of nicotine; yes/no).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The distribution of past-30-day cigarette use at follow-up for the (L) overall sample, and (R) sample of past 30-day e-cigarette users, by demographics.", out.width = '100%', fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/F1.png")
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
table1 <- read_excel("table1.xlsx")
colnames(table1)[1] <- ""

table1 %>% 
  kable(caption = 'Participant characteristics at baseline and association of each characteristic with number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days at follow-up; N = 1312.', align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 30) %>%
  row_spec(0, color = "black", background = "lightgrey") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "15%") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "30%") %>%
  pack_rows("Gender", 1, 2) %>%
  pack_rows("Race/ethnicity", 3, 5) %>%
  pack_rows("Education (highest parental)", 6, 8) %>%
  pack_rows("E-cigarette use", 9, 11)
```

# Results

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calculated. In `posterdown` this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical R Markdown formatting.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%', fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/F2a.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The distribution of past-30-day cigarette use at follow-up by four e-cigarette characteristics of current e-cigarette at baseline.", out.width = '100%', fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/F2b.png")
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
table2 <- read_excel("table2.xlsx")
colnames(table2)[1] <- ""
table2[6:7, 5] <- ""

table2 %>% 
  kable(caption = 'Association between e-cigarette characteristics at baseline and number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days at follow-up; N=1312', align = 'c') %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 2, 
    "Association with Number of Cigarettes Smoked in Past 30 Days at Follow-up" = 3)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 30, full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, color = "black", background = "lightgrey") %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "20%") %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "25%") %>%
  pack_rows("Device type", 2, 3， latex_gap_space = "1") %>%
  pack_rows("Nicotine", 4, 5) %>%
  pack_rows("Dripping", 6, 7)
```


# Conclusion

Use of mods (vs. pen-like) e-cigarette devices was **strongly, positively associated** with the number of cigarettes smoked approximately 1 year later at follow-up. Additional research is needed to explore `causal pathways for the observed associations`. If these associations were causal, device type and characteristics may be a target for regulation to reduce the burden of tobacco related disease that may result from adolescent and young adult vaping.
